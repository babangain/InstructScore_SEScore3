Error type 1: The meaning of the predicate is wrongly interpreted in the text
Major/minor:  Major
Error location 1: "in the expensive price range"
Explanation for error 1: The input RDF states that the price range is "cheap," but the incorrect generation mentions the expensive price range, which significantly changes the meaning.
Error dimension 2: Fluency
Error type 2: The text is unclear or open to multiple interpretations
