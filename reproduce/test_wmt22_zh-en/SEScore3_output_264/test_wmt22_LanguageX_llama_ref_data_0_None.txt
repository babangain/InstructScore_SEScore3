Error type 2: Incorrect translation does not accurately represent the correct translation
Major/minor: Major
Error location 2: "such as the suspension of production by car companies and the increase in the price of mobile phones"
Explanation for error 2: The correct translation should be "including the suspension of production by car companies and the increase in the price of mobile phones".
